## React To-Do-List App

This is my first app built using react. 
It's only a simple to-do list which I followed an online tutorial to create, but it works!

Relatively straight forward, I encountered a few problems making this app which were only due to the tutorials age, i.e. the latest version of webpack not working with this tutorial, but they were quickly fixed.

I've found a few little bugs such as the edit input not throwing an error when left blank or having the same input as another list item. To try and deepen my understanding of React I will attempt to fix this error myself, as well as adding in some CSS just to make the project look a little neater.

This App uses:

  * React
  * ReactDOM
  * Lodash
  * Webpack
  * Webpack Dev Server
  * Babel:
    * Core
    * Loader
    * Preset-es2015
    * Preset-React
  * React Hot Loader
